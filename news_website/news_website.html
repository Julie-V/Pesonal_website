			<h4>Trump bid to restore travel ban rejected</h4>
			<p>The US federal appeals court has rejected the Trump administration's request to reinstate a travel ban blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</br> The late night ruling means the travel ban will remain suspended until the full case has been heard. The court gave the White House and the states challenging it a deadline of Monday to present more arguments. State lawyers had said the travel ban, affecting people from seven countries, was unconstitutional.

			<p>The decree triggered the largest street protests in the country since the fall of communism in 1989. Bowing to pressure, PM Sorin Grindeanu said on Sunday: "I do not want to divide Romania." Tens of thousands of protesters in Bucharest cheered the move, but vowed to keep the pressure on the cabinet. They said they would continue their rallies until the decree - which was passed on Tuesday and was due to come into effect on 10 February - was actually repealed. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38871667" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
